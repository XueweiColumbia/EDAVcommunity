Background,"Based on daily conversation to fellow classmates, I realized that many students who wish to go to a Chinese Data Science company often face language barrier in their interviews, because many Statistical / Data Science / Computer Science termsâ€™ translation are not very evident. One may have no idea what the interviewer was asking about because of non-trivial translation, even though he or she knows the topic very well in English. Therefore, I started this Chinese - English Data Science dictionary to help ease the interview process.",,,,
Structure,"The dictionary is grouped by topic, and each topic is a separate sheet. The first column is a label indicating whether this translation entry is evident or not. 1 means non-evident, and 0 means evident. One may sort decreasingly on this column so that they can learn non-evident phrases first. The second column is simplified Chinese. The third column is English.",,,,
