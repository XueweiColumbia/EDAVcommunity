Based on daily conversation to fellow classmates, I realized that many students who wish to go to a Chinese Data Science company often face language barrier in their interviews, because many Statistical / Data Science / Computer Science termsâ€™ translation are not very evident. One may have no idea what the interviewer was asking about because of non-trivial translation, even though he or she knows the topic very well in English. Therefore, I started this Chinese - English Data Science dictionary to help ease the interview process.
